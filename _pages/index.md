Hello, and welcome to the personal portfolio of Kiran Mohammadi-Williams (she/hers). I'm a library professional, and have been working in libraries and museum (GLAM) spaces since 2021. I'm particularly interested in digital humanities, special collections and paper conservation, book history, textile history, medievalisms, classics, and art history. I'm excited and challenged when I have the opportunity to explore the intersections of art and information!

I'm a medievalist, studying the iconography of clerical vestments from the Latin West (particularly Germany and England) ca. 1250-1400 and their performance and relationship to the human body, sensorial experience, and liturgical performance. I'm also an avid knitter, embroiderer, reader, and cat parent to a seven-year-old Torbie named Camilla, who hates all other cats. I'm also a proud hijabi and a native and ardent New Jerseyan. You won't find any photos of me on this page, since I like to protect my modesty, but feel free to imagine the crotchety old cat lady of your dreams and you're probably close.

This site was created using a modified version of <a href="https://github.com/byanko55/jekyll-theme-satellite">byanko55's jekyll-theme-satellite</a>. This site also embraces intentionlly non-modern, imperfect, and joyful aesthetics, in contrast with how web-building seems to have developed in recent years. For more thoughs on this, read [[My personal soapbox on the web]]. The site is built with the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and follows principles of [minimal computing](https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/about/).
